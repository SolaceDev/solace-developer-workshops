name: sam-tools-and-skills
description: Use when extending a Solace Agent Mesh agent with custom code or curated tool packages — writing a custom tool in Go (samtoolsdk) or Python (sam-tool-sdk), scaffolding with the `sam toolset` / `sam skill` CLI, packaging tools as a toolset, creating an agent skill bundle (SKILL.md + bundled tools), exposing a REST API to one agent via an inline OpenAPI tool, attaching toolsets/skills to agents, or setting per-agent tool config. Not for no-code data/service access where a connector type fits (sam-connectors), inbound integrations where users or events reach agents (sam-gateways), or the agent's own instructions and behavior (sam-author-agent).

# sam-tools-and-skills

This skill covers **custom tools and tool packages** for SAM agents: Go and Python remote tools that run in the STR (Secure Tool Runtime), inline OpenAPI tools, toolsets, and agent skill bundles. **Scope check:** if a no-code connector type fits (SQL, knowledge base, search, document/graph DBs, REST via OpenAPI shared across agents, remote MCP, email, Slack, event mesh), use `sam-connectors` first — custom code is for when no connector type fits. Inbound (users/events/MCP clients reaching agents) → `sam-gateways`. The agent's instructions/behavior → `sam-author-agent`.

## Picking the construct

| The user wants… | Construct | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Custom logic in Go (compiled binary, typed params, artifacts) | Go remote tool via `pkg/samtoolsdk` | [references/go-tools.md](references/go-tools.md) |
| Custom logic in Python | Python remote tool via `sam-tool-sdk` (PyPI) | [references/python-tools.md](references/python-tools.md) |
| One agent calling a REST API from an OpenAPI spec, config-file managed | Inline `tool_type: openapi` tool — but **shared/UI-managed API access is the `api` connector** (`sam-connectors`) | [references/openapi-tools.md](references/openapi-tools.md) |
| A reusable package of always-available tools, uploaded once, attached to many agents | **Toolset** | [references/packaging-and-deploy.md](references/packaging-and-deploy.md) |
| Tools *plus* usage instructions the agent loads on demand (`load_skill`) | **Skill bundle** (SKILL.md + references + optional bundled tools) | [references/packaging-and-deploy.md](references/packaging-and-deploy.md) |

Toolset vs skill in one line: a toolset is bare tools, always on the agent's tool list; a skill is instructions first (progressively disclosed at runtime) with tools optionally bundled. Tools that need workflow guidance → skill; standalone utilities → toolset.

## The intended authoring path (teach this, in order)

1. **Scaffold** — `sam toolset init NAME --lang go|python` or `sam skill init NAME [--with-tool --lang go|python]`. The scaffold is a *working* tool: compilable code, `manifest.yaml`, `build.sh`/`build.bat`. Go scaffolds vendor the SDK into `_sdk/samtoolsdk/` from the CLI binary itself — building needs **no network and no access to the SAM repo**. Python scaffolds depend on `sam-tool-sdk` from PyPI.
2. **Author** — edit the generated tool. Real API names are in the references; do not improvise them.
3. **Validate** — `sam toolset validate` / `sam skill validate` builds for your host and runs the exact `--schema` discovery the STR performs. Run it before every package.
4. **Package & deploy** — `sam toolset package` / `sam skill package` cross-compiles for the deployed STR's architecture and zips for WebUI upload; or keep the source in a declarative-config repo and let `sam config plan` / `apply` build and upload (that flow is owned by `sam-declarative-config`).
5. **Attach** — by name, in the agent builder UI (per-tool config form, secrets masked) or in the agent's declarative spec.

## Hard rules (each counters an observed failure)

- **Go product, Go patterns.** SAM-Go has **no** `tool_type: python`, no `component_module`/`component_base_path`, no ADK `ToolContext`, no `sam plugin add` — the runtime logs a migration warning for `tool_type: python` and registers nothing. Python tools run as **subprocess remote tools in the STR** via `sam-tool-sdk`. **Never route to `solace-agent-mesh-plugin-creator`** — it is Python SAM.
- **Scaffold first, never SDK code from memory.** Baseline sessions invented `samtoolsdk.Tool[P]{}`, `tc.LoadArtifact`, `TextResult` — none exist. Start every tool from `sam toolset init` / `sam skill init --with-tool` output and the API tables in the references. If a symbol isn't in the reference, check the scaffold or the SDK source before using it.
- **Remote tools appear as `tool_type: builtin`** on the agent's `tools:` list — the dispatcher falls through to the STR when the name isn't an in-process built-in. Toolset and skill attachment generate these entries for you (`toolsetname__toolname`, `skillname__toolname` — `__` separator, charset `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`).
- **Two OpenAPI constructs exist — say which and why.** Shared across agents, UI-managed, platform-credentialed → `api` connector (`sam-connectors`). Agent-local, declarative-config-managed → inline `tool_type: openapi`. Recommending an MCP wrapper or a dedicated proxy agent for a plain REST API is wrong when these exist.
- **Never write resource YAML from memory.** Toolset metadata (`kind: toolset`, `spec.config`), agent attachment (`toolsets:`, `toolsetConfigs:`, `skillRefs`), and tool stanzas are authored via the builder UI or the **`sam-declarative-config`** skill (its `toolset.md`, `skill.md`, `tool-build.md`, `agent.md` references are the YAML source of truth). This skill names keys; it does not assemble config blocks. Urgency never licenses memory-YAML.
- **Secrets:** `${VAR}` references, never literals; toolset-level `spec.config` for secrets, per-agent overlay for non-secret tunables. A credential pasted into chat is exposed — say so once, advise rotation, reference it as `${VAR}` thereafter.
- **Cross-compile is part of the product, not the user's problem.** The packaged binary must match the deployed STR's OS/arch; `package` resolves it from the platform (`sam toolset build-target` to inspect; `SAM_TOOL_TARGET_OS`/`SAM_TOOL_TARGET_ARCH` to override). If the platform reports no discovered target, packaging stops rather than shipping a wrong-arch zip.
