name: sam-projects
description: Use when a user wants an assistant to answer from their OWN uploaded documents with no code — "upload my PDFs/policies so the assistant can answer from them", creating or setting up a Project, uploading files to a project, "why isn't my project using my documents / the assistant ignores my files", the project Instructions field or default-agent settings, or choosing between a Project and a knowledge_base connector. Covers the WebUI Projects feature (the document workspace), NOT the `sam config` declarative-config directory (also historically called a "project").

# sam-projects

**Scope check:** this skill covers **Projects** — the SAM WebUI feature where a user uploads documents and an assistant answers from them. To control an agent's tone / rules / behavior see `sam-author-agent`; for cloud-managed (Amazon Bedrock) document RAG see `sam-connectors` (knowledge_base); for the `sam config` directory of declarative YAML (also called a "project") see `sam-declarative-config`.

## What a Project is

A **Project** is a document workspace in the WebUI: a user uploads files, SAM indexes them automatically, and an assistant answers questions grounded in them — **no code, no cloud setup.** It's the primary no-code way to put "a pile of my own documents" behind an assistant.

Projects are a **WebUI + REST feature — there is no `sam` CLI command** for them. The deployment must have **persistence configured** (a database); on a no-persistence dev setup the Projects surface is unavailable. The feature is always on wherever persistence is configured.

## The flow (all in the WebUI)

1. **Projects** → create a project (name + optional description).
2. **Knowledge** section → upload files. SAM **automatically** builds a search index in the background — wait for the "processing" indicator to finish. Until it does, the assistant can't search those files yet.
3. **Default agent** → pick the agent new chats in the project start with (still switchable per chat).
4. Start a chat **inside the project** and ask. The assistant gets a built-in search over the uploaded files and answers from them.

## What you can upload

Indexed for search: **PDF, Word (`.docx`), PowerPoint (`.pptx`)**, and text formats (Markdown, CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, HTML, plain text, …). Default limit **10 MB per file** (the deployment can raise it). A **scanned-image PDF with no text layer won't index** — there's no text to extract. Other binary types may upload but aren't searched.

## Two project settings — what they do, and their limits

- **The project "Instructions" field DOES steer the assistant — but only as first-message framing.** When a user starts a **new** chat inside the project, SAM prepends the project's workspace framing plus the Instructions (and description) to the user's first message, so the assistant follows them for tone and framing. Limits worth stating plainly: it is injected as **message context on the first message of a newly started in-project chat** — it is **not** applied as the agent's own system instruction, and it is **not** re-injected into a chat that was already underway. For rules that must hold on every turn, across every agent, put them in the **agent's own instruction** (→ `sam-author-agent`); use the project Instructions field for lightweight, project-scoped guidance.
- **The "default agent" is a convenience default, not a hard binding** — it's the agent new chats in the project open with; the user can change it per chat. Don't describe it as "the project forces this agent."

## "The assistant isn't using my documents" — check, in order

1. **Indexing still running (or never ran).** Uploads index asynchronously — wait for "processing" to finish. If it never starts, the files may all be non-indexable types.
2. **Unsupported / empty-text file.** Scanned-image PDFs, images, or odd binaries yield no searchable text. Re-add as a real PDF / Word / text file.
3. **The chat isn't in the project.** A generic new chat isn't scoped to the project — start the chat from inside the project.
4. **Search is keyword-based (BM25), not semantic.** If the question's wording is very different from the document text, it may not match. Use words closer to what the documents actually say.
5. **No persistence.** Project search needs the deployment's persistence configured; indexing is automatic wherever persistence is present.

Don't invent a tool name (e.g. a `customerdocuments_*` tool seen in the environment) — project search is a built-in capability over the project's own index, not a separate connector or MCP tool.

## Project vs. knowledge_base connector

Both let an assistant answer from documents — pick by infrastructure, not by feature envy:

| | **Project** | **knowledge_base connector** |
|---|---|---|
| Where docs live | SAM's own artifact storage | **Amazon Bedrock** (cloud) |
| Indexing | Automatic, local — BM25 keyword | Bedrock-managed vector RAG |
| Setup | Upload in the UI — no cloud | Needs an AWS account + a Bedrock Knowledge Base |
| Best for | No-code, no-cloud, your own files | Teams already on Bedrock / large managed KBs |

**No cloud setup wanted → Project.** Already running a Bedrock Knowledge Base → the `knowledge_base` connector (→ `sam-connectors`).

## Sharing & moving

A project is **owner-private by default**. When project sharing is enabled in the deployment, share with teammates as **editor or viewer** (owner is the project's creator, not a level you grant). A project — its files plus settings — can be exported and imported as a ZIP.
